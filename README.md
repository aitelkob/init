# Init: System and Network Administration Project :computer:

## Overview :telescope:

The "init" project is a foundational step into the world of system and network administration. Designed with the intent to introduce basic commands, essential services on a server machine, and scripting practices, this project serves as a practical initiation for aspiring SysAdmins. By engaging with real-world scenarios, participants will gain hands-on experience that lays the groundwork for advanced study and professional development in the field of IT infrastructure.

## Project Goals :dart:

This project aims to:

- Introduce participants to basic system and network commands. :gear:
- Provide an understanding of commonly used services on a server. :server:
- Explore scripting techniques to automate daily SysAdmin tasks. :scroll:

## Structure :file_folder:

The repository is organized into three key sections:

- [**Network**](https://github.com/aitelkob/init/tree/master/network): Exercises and scripts related to network configuration and analysis. :globe_with_meridians:
- [**System**](https://github.com/aitelkob/init/tree/master/system): Tasks focusing on system administration, including system setup, monitoring, and management. :desktop_computer:
- [**Scripts**](https://github.com/aitelkob/init/tree/master/scripts): Custom scripts designed to automate various SysAdmin tasks. :memo:

## Getting Started :rocket:

To dive into the project, follow the instructions outlined in each directory. Start with the network section to get acquainted with basic networking commands, proceed to system for a deeper look into system administration, and finally, explore scripts to learn about scripting for automation and efficiency.

## Prerequisites :books:

- Basic knowledge of terminal commands and Linux environment. :linux:
- Access to a Linux distribution (preferably Debian-based for consistency with project instructions). :penguin:

## Contributing :raising_hand:
