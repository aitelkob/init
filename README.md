# Init: System and Network Administration Project

## Overview

The "init" project is a foundational step into the world of system and network administration. Designed with the intent to introduce basic commands, essential services on a server machine, and scripting practices, this project serves as a practical initiation for aspiring SysAdmins. By engaging with real-world scenarios, participants will gain hands-on experience that lays the groundwork for advanced study and professional development in the field of IT infrastructure.

## Project Goals

This project aims to:

- Introduce participants to basic system and network commands.
- Provide an understanding of commonly used services on a server.
- Explore scripting techniques to automate daily SysAdmin tasks.

## Structure

The repository is organized into three key sections:

- **Network**: Exercises and scripts related to network configuration and analysis.
- **System**: Tasks focusing on system administration, including system setup, monitoring, and management.
- **Scripts**: Custom scripts designed to automate various SysAdmin tasks.

## Getting Started

To dive into the project, follow the instructions outlined in each directory. Start with the network section to get acquainted with basic networking commands, proceed to system for a deeper look into system administration, and finally, explore scripts to learn about scripting for automation and efficiency.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of terminal commands and Linux environment.
- Access to a Linux distribution (preferably Debian-based for consistency with project instructions).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions and suggestions to improve the project. Whether it's adding new scripts, refining existing tasks, or providing alternative solutions, your input is valuable. Please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for more information on how to contribute.
