# Network Analysis and Scripting :satellite:

## Overview :mag_right:

This project is a comprehensive exploration into network administration, focusing on the utilization of Unix/Linux command-line tools and scripting to solve common network-related tasks. Through a series of scripts, I've demonstrated the ability to **automate** the process of gathering and analyzing network information, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy.

## Skills and Knowledge Demonstrated :brain:

1. **Scripting Proficiency** :computer:  
   Developed scripts using Bash, showcasing the ability to automate complex tasks and process data efficiently. This includes error handling, input validation, and utilizing command-line tools within scripts.

2. **Network Analysis** :globe_with_meridians:  
   Gained hands-on experience with network diagnostics and analysis tools such as `dig`, `nslookup`, `whois`, and `ifconfig`/`ip`. This involved resolving domain names, finding external IP addresses, querying DNS server information, and more.

3. **DNS and Routing Understanding** :world_map:  
   Demonstrated a deep understanding of DNS resolution processes, how to identify the DNS servers being used, and the ability to query specific DNS records and external DNS servers.

4. **Linux/Unix Command Line Mastery** :penguin:  
   Utilized a wide range of Unix/Linux command-line utilities to manipulate output, filter results, and extract specific data points from complex datasets.

5. **Problem-Solving and Research** :detective:  
   Showcased the ability to research, adapt, and employ various commands and scripting techniques to extract necessary information, highlighting problem-solving skills and adaptability.

6. **Network Configuration Awareness** :wrench:  
   Developed a foundational understanding of network interfaces and configuration files on Unix/Linux systems, enhancing the ability to diagnose and resolve network configuration issues.

## Project Contents :file_folder:

- [**find_active_interface.sh**](https://github.com/aitelkob/init/blob/master/network/find_active_interface.sh): Determines the active network interface of the system.
- [**find_dns_response.sh**](https://github.com/aitelkob/init/blob/master/network/find_dns_response.sh): Queries a specified domain against an external DNS server to showcase DNS resolution process.
- [**find_dns_servers.sh**](https://github.com/aitelkob/init/blob/master/network/find_dns_servers.sh): Extracts and displays the DNS server configuration for the host system.
- [**find_domain_info.sh**](https://github.com/aitelkob/init/blob/master/network/find_domain_info.sh): Utilizes the `whois` command to gather and present detailed domain registration information.
- [**find_domain_ip.sh**](https://github.com/aitelkob/init/blob/master/network/find_domain_ip.sh): Retrieves the external IP address of a given domain, demonstrating DNS lookup and IP resolution skills.
- [**find_hosting_provider.sh**](https://github.com/aitelkob/init/blob/master/network/find_hosting_provider.sh): Analyzes the `whois` output to identify the hosting provider of a domain, illustrating knowledge of domain registration data structures.

## Conclusion :trophy:

Completing these tasks has significantly enhanced my practical knowledge of network administration, scripting, and data analysis on Unix/Linux systems. I am now proficient in automating network diagnostics and configuration tasks, which are crucial skills in system administration and IT infrastructure roles. This project stands as a testament to my technical capabilities and my commitment to leveraging technology to solve complex problems efficiently.
