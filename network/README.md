# Network Analysis and Scripting :satellite:

## Overview :mag_right:

This project is a comprehensive exploration into network administration, focusing on the utilization of Unix/Linux command-line tools and scripting to solve common network-related tasks. Through a series of scripts, I've demonstrated the ability to **automate** the process of gathering and analyzing network information, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy.

## Skills and Knowledge Demonstrated :brain:

1. **Scripting Proficiency** :computer:  
   Developed scripts using Bash, showcasing the ability to automate complex tasks and process data efficiently. This includes error handling, input validation, and utilizing command-line tools within scripts.

2. **Network Analysis** :globe_with_meridians:  
   Gained hands-on experience with network diagnostics and analysis tools such as `dig`, `nslookup`, `whois`, and `ifconfig`/`ip`. This involved resolving domain names, finding external IP addresses, querying DNS server information, and more.

3. **DNS and Routing Understanding** :world_map:  
   Demonstrated a deep understanding of DNS resolution processes, how to identify the DNS servers being used, and the ability to query specific DNS records and external DNS servers.

4. **Linux/Unix Command Line Mastery** :penguin:  
   Utilized a wide range of Unix/Linux command-line utilities to manipulate output, filter results, and extract specific data points from complex datasets.

5. **Problem-Solving and Research** :detective:  
   Showcased the ability to research, adapt, and employ various commands and scripting techniques to extract necessary information, highlighting problem-solving skills and adaptability.

6. **Network Configuration Awareness** :wrench:  
   Developed a foundational understanding of network interfaces and configuration files on Unix/Linux systems, enhancing the ability to diagnose and resolve network configuration issues.
