# System Administration and Scripting :gear:

## Overview :mag_right:

This project dives into the realm of system administration on Unix/Linux systems, employing both command-line utilities and scripting to address a variety of system-related tasks. The aim is to demonstrate how automation and scripting can significantly enhance the management and monitoring of system resources, user activities, and service configurations.

## Skills and Knowledge Demonstrated :brain:

1. **System Scripting Proficiency** :computer:  
   Showcased the ability to craft scripts for automating system administration tasks, including managing processes, analyzing system usage, and modifying system configurations. These scripts highlight not only coding skills but also an understanding of system internals.

2. **System Monitoring and Management** :bar_chart:  
   Engaged with tools and commands for monitoring system health, resources, and activity, such as `top`, `ps`, `df`, and `du`. This illustrates a comprehensive approach to keeping a pulse on system performance and optimizing operations.

3. **Process and Service Management** :wrench:  
   Demonstrated command over managing system processes and services, employing commands like `systemctl` and `launchctl` to control service states, showcasing the ability to ensure system stability and reliability.

4. **Filesystem and Storage Analysis** :file_folder:  
   Utilized commands to inspect and manage filesystem usage and disk partitions, revealing an adeptness in managing storage resources and planning for capacity needs.

5. **User Session and Activity Tracking** :detective:  
   Exhibited skills in monitoring and managing user sessions, employing techniques to list active users and manage system access, thus ensuring secure and efficient system use.

6. **Advanced System Configuration** :gear:  
   Addressed advanced system configuration tasks, including network settings, firewall rules, and service configurations, through both manual command-line adjustments and scripting.
