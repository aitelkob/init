# Linux
# Use 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' to follow the syslog, script should run this in the background.
# macOS does not use /var/log/syslog, equivalent logs can be followed using 'log stream' or accessing files in /var/log/.

# Note: macOS specific commands might vary based on the logging system version and configuration.
