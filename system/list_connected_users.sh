# Linux and macOS
who # Lists every user currently logged into the computer.

# Alternatively, for more detailed information:
w # Shows who is logged on and what they are doing.

# Explanation:
# The 'who' command provides a list of users currently logged into the system, showing their login name, the terminal they're logged into, the date and time of their login, and their host name if they're logging in from a remote location.
# The 'w' command extends this by showing what each user is doing, including the command they're running, making it useful for a more comprehensive overview of system activity.
